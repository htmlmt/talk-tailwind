    <h2>Who we are</h2>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        In 1931, Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Theodore W. Metcalf found himself to be Acting Governor for several weeks. To please some of his friends, he appointed 20 to 25 "prominent Nebraskans" as Admirals; hence, the Great Navy of the State of Nebraska was born.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the practice of awarding commissions to the more or less "prominent" has persisted, a requirement for some meaningful act or service to the state or community has become more and more necessary to obtain an Admiral certificate.    
    </p>
    <p>
        It is believed that several hundred thousand Admirals have been appointed. Many Nebraskans and visitors to our state have not heard of our navy; they have not heard of the waves of prairie schooners that at one time plied our plains under which lies our real wealthâ€”Nebraska's underground sea.
