This is a one-page site that demonstrates the Tailwind CSS framework and accompanies a talk given at South Dakota Code Camp 2019.

## Project setup

This project uses Gulp to concatenate and minify JS, compile SCSS to CSS, and convert Twig templates into HTML.

To install node modules, run: `npm install`

To start a server to the static HTML files and watch src files for changes, run: `gulp`
